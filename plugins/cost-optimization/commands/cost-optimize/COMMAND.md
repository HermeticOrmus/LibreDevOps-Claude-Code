# /cost-optimize

A quick-access command for cost-optimization workflows in Claude Code.

## Trigger

`/cost-optimize [action] [options]`

## Input

### Actions
- `analyze` - Analyze existing cost-optimization implementation
- `generate` - Generate new cost-optimization artifacts
- `improve` - Suggest improvements to current implementation
- `validate` - Check implementation against best practices
- `document` - Generate documentation for cost-optimization artifacts

### Options
- `--context <path>` - Specify the file or directory to operate on
- `--format <type>` - Output format (markdown, json, yaml)
- `--verbose` - Include detailed explanations
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying them

## Process

### Step 1: Context Gathering
- Read relevant files and configuration
- Identify the current state of cost-optimization artifacts

### Step 3: Execution
- Apply the requested action
- Generate or modify artifacts as needed
- Validate changes against requirements

### Step 4: Output
- Present results in the requested format
- Include actionable next steps
- Flag any items requiring human decision
